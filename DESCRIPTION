Description: Functions to compute p-values based on permutation tests. Regression, ANOVA and ANCOVA, omnibus F-tests, marginal unilateral and bilateral t-tests are available. Several methods to handle nuisance variables are implemented. An extension for the comparison of signals issued from experimental conditions (e.g. EEG/ERP signals) is provided. Several corrections for multiple testing are possible, including the cluster-mass statistic and the threshold-free cluster enhancement.
