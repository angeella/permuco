Description: Functions to compute p-values based on permutation tests. For regression, ANOVA and ANCOVA, omnibus F-tests and marginal unilateral and bilateral t-tests are available. Several methods to handle nuisance variables are implemented.  An extension for the comparison of signals issued from experimental conditions (e.g. EEG/ERP signals) is provided. Several corrections for  multiple testing are possible, including the cluster-mass statistic and the threshold-free cluster enhancement.
